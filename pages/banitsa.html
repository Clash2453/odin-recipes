                <h2>About:</h2>
                <p>
                    Banitsa is really easy to make and can feed a crowd of hungry folks. You can even make variations by adding ground meat or cooked butternut squash.
                </p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 package phyllo dough 400 g</li>
                    <li>3/4 pound feta cheese 350 g</li>
                    <li>7 eggs</li>
                    <li>1 cup plain yogurt 250 g</li>
                    <li>½ cup water</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons butter melted or avocado oil</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>                
                </ul>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        In a large bowl, break up the feta cheese using a fork as much as possible. Add the eggs and mix well. Then add the yogurt along with the baking soda and mix again. Then add the melted butter or oil and mix well. Finally, add the water and mix again.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Get the largest baking pan you have (a 13’’ round pan is traditional, but you can user a 9’’ x 13’’ pan), use two spoons of the mixture to lightly cover the bottom from edge to edge. The idea is to have the phyllo stick so when the banitsa is flipped upside down after baking it doesn’t fall out.
                    </li>

                        Preheat oven to 390F, while letting the banitsa sit at room temperature for 15 minutes then bake in the oven for 26-30 minutes, or until the top is deep golden brown. If the top gets too dark place a sheet of tin foil or parchment over it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remove banitsa from oven and carefully flip it upside down. It’s easier if you balance the pan on a couple of bowls so there is a gap between the pan and the counter while it is hanging upside down. You may skip this step of flipping the banitsa over, but it will deflate and won’t get fluffy.

                        Allow to cool upside down for 20 minutes then enjoy!
