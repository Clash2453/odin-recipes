                </p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>10 large cabbage leaves or 20 small pickled</li>
                <li>1 large onion finely chopped</li>
                <li>3,5 oz/ 100 g cremini mushrooms finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 large carrot finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 ⅓ cup/ 230 g rice any kind</li>
                <li>⅓ cup/ 50 g raisins optional</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried savory</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley finely chopped, optional</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon dried spearmint optional</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the large leaves in two, removing the hard ribs at the bottom of each leaf. Stack the leaves on a plate and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a non stick pan and sauté the onion for 1-2 minutes. Add the carrots and the mushrooms and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring from time to time.
                </li>
                <li>Add the rice and cook for few minutes, until translucent. Add the spices and the raisins, stir and remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Extend the cabbage leaves on a kitchen board. Fill each one with 1-2 tablespoon of the filling, depending on the size of the leaf. Wrap the filling into the leaf and roll it.</li>
                <li>Arrange the cabbage rolls in a pot with the wrapped part facing the bottom. Place them closely one next to another. You can make 2 or 3 layers of sarmi, depending on how big is your pot.</li>
                <li>Place an inverted plate on top of your sarmi and cover the pot with a lid. Pour 1 – 1,5 cups of water into the pot: make sure the water level reaches the top roll sarmi so that the rice gets cooked.</li>
                <li>Cook for 25-30 minutes on the stove at a low heat. Don’t allow the water to boil violently so that the cabbage rolls stay neat.</li>
                <li>The dish is ready when the rice is completely cooked. Remove from heat and serve immediately with some of the sauce from the pot.</li>
            </ol>
