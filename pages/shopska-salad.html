                <p>
                    Shopska salata is a salad that originated in the Shopluk region of Bulgaria. It is said to have been invented in the 1950s as part of a tourism promotion by the socialist party to highlight local ingredients. Different salads, from other Bulgarian regions, were also created, but only the shopska survived, and it's now considered a national dish.
